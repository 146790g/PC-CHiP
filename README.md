# Pan-Cancer Computational Histopathology (PC-CHiP) analysis using deep learning

This directory contains the code to quantify histopathology features from H&E stained histopathology images using Inception-V4 in a Pan-cancer tissue classification setting.

The code is written in shell and python.

## Dataset

The histopathology images used in training are from TCGA (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/), open access to all. Only images from frozen tissue are included.

The histopathology images used in training are from METABRIC (https://ega-archive.org/dacs/EGAC00001000484), controlled access.

The dataset is composed with 42 normal and tumor tissue types from 28 cancers. Labels used in the classification can be found here /data/codebook.txt.

## How to use
Run inception/pipeline.sh (change relative paths)
